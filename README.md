# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

## Dataset
Download the dataset for this project from following Link

## Data Information
The dataset has 3390 rows and 17 columns
* id : unique id of a person

* age : Age of the patient

* education :

* sex : male or female

* is_smoking: whether or not the patient is a current smoker ("YES" or "NO")

* Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be

* considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)

* BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)

* Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)

* Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)

* Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal)

* Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)

* Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)

* Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)

* BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)

* Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)

* Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)

* TenYearCHD : 10 year risk of coronary heart disease (1 - Yes, 0 - No)

## Conclusions
From Exploratory data Analysis, we can conclude that

* Our dependent feature, is actually an indicator variable with only two possible values; 0 and 1

* Some featutres like prevalentStroke, prevalentHyp, diabetes, BPMeds, education and target features should be categorical features.

* Most number of patient's age falls in the range 35 - 45

* most number of patients belongs to education category '1.0'.

* Most number of patients smoke cigerette in range of 0 - 10.

* Most number of patients are not on BP Medications

* Most number of patients does not have a stroke previously

* Most number of patients are hot hypertensive.

* Most number of patients are not diabetic.

* Most number of patient's Cholestrol falls in the range 200 - 300

* Most number of patient's Systolic Blood Pressure falls in the range 100 - 150

* Most number of patient's Diastolic Blood Pressure falls in the range 70 - 90

* Most number of patient's BMI falls in the range 20 - 30. And a very few has above 40

* Most number of patient's Heart Rate falls in the range 70 - 90

* Most number of patient's Glucose levels falls in the range 50 - 100.

* Most of the patients are females.

* Almost half of the patients have a habit of smoking

* Outliers present in continous features except age column.

* The feature 'cigsPerDay' is equally distributed, which means the feature is not a good predictor.

* The patients who have more age, totChol, sysBP, diaBP, BMI, heartRate, glucose are tending towards risk of coronary heart disease

* 58.4 % of females and 41.5 % of males have no risk of CHD

* 46.7 % of females 53.22 % of males have risk of CHD

* 50.9 % of people who doesnt smoke have no risk of CHD

* 49 % of people who smoke have no risk of CHD

* 46.1 % of people who doesnt smoke have risk of CHD

* 53.8 % of people who smoke have risk of CHD

By fitting the data into various classification models and evaluating with test data, we can conclude that,

* For our problem statement, we have two cases

* Case 1 : if a person has a disease but the model shows the person has no risk. For this case recall is the best evaluation metric

* Case 2 : if a person has no risk of disease but the models predicts the person has a risk. For this case, precision is the best evaluation metric

* When both of the above cases are important, we can use F1_score evaluation metric

* If Recall is important, i.e., if we want to focus on case 1, then Logistic Regression and KNN models are preferrable

* If Precision is important i.e., if we want to focus on case 2, then Naive Bayes model is preferrable

* If F_Score is important, i.e., if we want to focus on both case 1 and case 2, then Logistic Regression model is preferrable

* For Random Forest Classifier, 'age' feature has more importance and least is 'PrevalentStroke'.

* For SVM Classifier, 'age' feature has more importance and least is 'prevalentStroke'.

* For Decision Tree Classifier , 'age' feature has more importance and least is 'prevalentStroke', 'diabetes'.

* For logistic regression, 'age' feature has more importance and least is 'BMI', 'diabetes', 'heartRate'.
